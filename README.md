# Dimensionlity-Reduction-for-Classfication
I primarily used the built-in PCA and LDA code from Scikit-Learn to perform dimensionality reduction on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. I did not carry out other dimensionality reduction operations (although I wrote the code) because they were too slow to run. It's possible that custom code may be needed for more efficient computations.
